# 🌟 Chaoyuhao's GitHub Profile 🌟

Hello there! I'm **chaoyuhao**, a senior Computer Science and Technology major at **Nanjing University**! 🎓 Passionate about multi-modal large language model & embodied AI, I'm actively exploring the open-source community. 🌐 Welcome to my GitHub profile, where you'll find some of my projects and learning notes.

## 📚 Education

- **Nanjing University** - Computer Science and Technology (2022 - )

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Programming Languages**: Python, C/C++, Java, Verilog
- **Embracing AI**: I am very familiar with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Deepseek, Qwen. 

## 🚀 Small Projects

- **[Sudoku]()** : A project containing an interesting algorithm which is strongly recommended by Daoxu Chen (Designer of ProblemSolving course in NJU)
- **[ICSPA2023]()** : Using software to simulate risc-v CPU and link it to abstract-machine and nan-os.
- **[OS2024]()** : Operating abstract-machine on multi threads.
- **[SCA$^3$]()** : Using Actor-critic algorithm to rearrange the placement of chargers to enhence the robustness of the network.
- **[TrafficAnalysis]()** A YOLOv11x model with transfer learning on our own datasets. It can precisely count the number of cars in the photo of a traffic camera.
- **[OpenJiuxiang]()** : The CPU of team `我造CPU，真的假的？`, which has won the 2nd prize in Loongson Competition 2024 final.
- **[MMVPR]()** : Our fine tuned and fusion model, which has won the 1st prize in ICPR'24 MMVPR workshop competition.

## Big Projects

- **[AnomalyR1]()** A few shot RL for MLLM in IAD domain tasks.
- **[Self Tool Synthesis System]()** : I designed this system when I was an AI algorithm intern in Huawei.
- **[OSWorld-XXX]()** : My future work from Bytedance DMC. To be continue!
